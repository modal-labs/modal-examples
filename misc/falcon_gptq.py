# # Run Falcon-40B with AutoGPTQ
#
# In this example, we run a quantized 4-bit version of Falcon-40B, the first open-source large language
# model of its size, using HuggingFace's [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)
# library and [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ).
#
# Due to the current limitations of the library, the inference speed is a little under 1 token/second and the
# cold start time on Modal is around 25s.
#
# For faster inference at the expense of a slower cold start, check out
# [Running Falcon-40B with `bitsandbytes` quantization](https://modal.com/docs/examples/falcon_bitsandbytes). You can also
# run a smaller model via the [Gemma 7B example](https://modal.com/docs/examples/vllm_gemma).
#
# ## Setup
#
# First we import the components we need from `modal`.

import modal

# ## Define a container image
#
# To take advantage of Modal's blazing fast cold-start times, we download model weights
# into a folder inside our container image. These weights come from a quantized model
# found on Huggingface.
IMAGE_MODEL_DIR = "/model"


def download_model():
    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

    model_name = "TheBloke/falcon-40b-instruct-GPTQ"
    snapshot_download(model_name, local_dir=IMAGE_MODEL_DIR)


# Now, we define our image. We'll use the `debian-slim` base image, and install the dependencies we need
# using [`pip_install`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Image#pip_install). At the end, we'll use
# [`run_function`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container#run-a-modal-function-during-your-build-with-run_function-beta) to run the
# function defined above as part of the image build.

image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.10")
    .apt_install("git")
    .pip_install(
        "auto-gptq==0.7.0",
        "einops==0.6.1",
        "hf-transfer==0.1.5",
        "huggingface_hub==0.14.1",
        "transformers==4.31.0",
    )
    # Use huggingface's hi-perf hf-transfer library to download this large model.
    .env({"HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER": "1"})
    .run_function(download_model)
)

# Let's instantiate and name our [`App`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps).
app = modal.App(name="example-falcon-gptq", image=image)


# ## The model class
#
# Next, we write the model code. We want Modal to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up,
# so we use [class syntax](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `@enter` decorator.
#
# Within the [`@app.cls`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App#cls) decorator, we use the [`gpu` parameter](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu)
# to specify that we want to run our function on an [A100 GPU](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu#a100-gpus). We also allow each call 10 mintues to complete,
# and request the runner to stay live for 5 minutes after its last request.
#
# The rest is just using the `transformers` library to run the model. Refer to the
# [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.31.0/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate)
# for more parameters and tuning.
#
# Note that we need to create a separate thread to call the `generate` function because we need to
# yield the text back from the streamer in the main thread. This is an idiosyncrasy with streaming in `transformers`.
