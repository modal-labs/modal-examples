# ## Overview
#
# Quick snippet showing how to connect to a Jupyter notebook server running inside a Modal container,
# especially useful for exploring the contents of Modal Volumes.
# This uses [Modal Tunnels](https://modal.com/docs/guide/tunnels#tunnels-beta)
# to create a tunnel between the running Jupyter instance and the internet.
#
# If you want to your Jupyter notebook to run _locally_ and execute remote Modal Functions in certain cells, see the `basic.ipynb` example :)

    "modal-examples-jupyter-inside-modal-data", create_if_missing=True
)

    # Bing it!
    from bing_image_downloader import downloader

    # This will save into the Modal volume and allow you view the images
    # from within Jupyter at a path like `/root/cache/modal labs/Image_1.png`.

# This is all that's needed to create a long-lived Jupyter server process in Modal
# that you can access in your Browser through a secure network tunnel.
# This can be useful when you want to interactively engage with Volume contents
# without having to download it to your host computer.

# Doing `modal run jupyter_inside_modal.py` will run a Modal app which starts
# the Juypter server at an address like https://u35iiiyqp5klbs.r3.modal.host.
# Visit this address in your browser, and enter the security token
# you set for `JUPYTER_TOKEN`.
