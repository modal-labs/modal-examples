# # Hello world wide web!

# Modal makes it easy to turn your Python functions into serverless web services:
# access them via a browser or call them from any client that speaks HTTP, all
# without having to worry about setting up servers or managing infrastructure.

# This tutorial shows the path with the shortest ["time to 200"](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/05/whats-your-apis-time-to-200/):
# [`modal.fastapi_endpoint`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.fastapi_endpoint).

# On Modal, web endpoints have all the superpowers of Modal Functions:
# they can be [accelerated with GPUs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu),
# they can access [Secrets](https://modal.com/docs/guide/secrets) or [Volumes](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes),
# and they [automatically scale](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cold-start) to handle more traffic.

# Under the hood, we use the [FastAPI library](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/),
# which has [high-quality documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/),
# linked throughout this tutorial.

# ## Turn a Modal Function into an API endpoint with a single decorator

# Modal Functions are already accessible remotely -- when you add the `@app.function` decorator to a Python function
# and run `modal deploy`, you make it possible for your [other Python functions to call it](https://modal.com/docs/guide/trigger-deployed-functions).

# That's great, but it's not much help if you want to share what you've written with someone running code in a different language --
# or not running code at all!

# And that's where most of the power of the Internet comes from: sharing information and functionality across different computer systems.

# So we provide the `fastapi_endpoint` decorator to wrap your Modal Functions in the lingua franca of the web: HTTP.
# Here's what that looks like:

import modal

image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("fastapi[standard]")
app = modal.App(name="example-basic-web", image=image)


@app.function()
@modal.fastapi_endpoint(
    docs=True  # adds interactive documentation in the browser
)
def hello():
    return "Hello world!"


# You can turn this function into a web endpoint by running `modal serve basic_web.py`.
# In the output, you should see a URL that ends with `hello-dev.modal.run`.
# If you navigate to this URL, you should see the `"Hello world!"` message appear in your browser.

# You can also find interactive documentation, powered by OpenAPI and Swagger,
# if you add `/docs` to the end of the URL.
# From this documentation, you can interact with your endpoint, sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses.
# For more details, see the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#automatic-docs).

# By running the endpoint with `modal serve`, you created a temporary endpoint that will disappear if you interrupt your terminal.
# These temporary endpoints are great for debugging -- when you save a change to any of your dependent files, the endpoint will redeploy.
# Try changing the message to something else, hitting save, and then hitting refresh in your browser or re-sending
# the request from `/docs` or the command line. You should see the new message, along with logs in your terminal showing the redeploy and the request.

# When you're ready to deploy this endpoint permanently, run `modal deploy basic_web.py`.
# Now, your function will be available even when you've closed your terminal or turned off your computer.

# ## Send data to a web endpoint

# The web endpoint above was a bit silly: it always returns the same message.

# Most endpoints need an input to be useful. There are two ways to send data to a web endpoint:
# - in the URL as a [query parameter](#sending-data-in-query-parameters)
# - in the [body of the request](#sending-data-in-the-request-body) as JSON

# ### Sending data in query parameters

# By default, your function's arguments are treated as query parameters:
# they are extracted from the end of the URL, where they should be added in the form
# `?arg1=foo&arg2=bar`.

# From the Python side, there's hardly anything to do:


@app.function()
@modal.fastapi_endpoint(docs=True)
def greet(user: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {user}!"


# If you are already running `modal serve basic_web.py`, this endpoint will be available at a URL, printed in your terminal, that ends with `greet-dev.modal.run`.

# We provide Python type-hints to get type information in the docs and
# [automatic validation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/).
# For example, if you navigate directly to the URL for `greet`, you will get a detailed error message
# indicating that the `user` parameter is missing. Navigate instead to `/docs` to see how to invoke the endpoint properly.

# You can read more about query parameters in the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/).


# ### Sending data in the request body

# For larger and more complex data, it is generally preferrable to send data in the body of the HTTP request.
# This body is formatted as [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON),
# the most common data interchange format on the web.

# To set up an endpoint that accepts JSON data, add an argument with a `dict` type-hint to your function.
# This argument will be populated with the data sent in the request body.


@app.function()
@modal.fastapi_endpoint(method="POST", docs=True)
def goodbye(data: dict) -> str:
    name = data.get("name") or "world"
    return f"Goodbye {name}!"


# Note that we gave a value of `"POST"` for the `method` argument here.
# This argument defines the HTTP request method that the endpoint will respond to,
# and it defaults to `"GET"`.
# If you head to the URL for the `goodbye` endpoint in your browser,
# you will get a 405 Method Not Allowed error, because browsers only send GET requests by default.
# While this is technically a separate concern from query parameters versus request bodies
# and you can define an endpoint that accepts GET requests and uses data from the body,
# it is [considered bad form](https://stackoverflow.com/a/983458).

# Navigate to `/docs` for more on how to invoke the endpoint properly.
# You will need to send a POST request with a JSON body containing a `name` key.
# To get the same typing and validation benefits as with query parameters,
# use a [Pydantic model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/)
# for this argument.

# You can read more about request bodies in the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/).

# ## Handle expensive startup with `modal.Cls`

# Sometimes your endpoint needs to do something before it can handle its first request,
# like get a value from a database or set the value of a variable.
# If that step is expensive, like [loading a large ML model](https://modal.com/docs/guide/model-weights),
# it'd be a shame to have to do it every time a request comes in!

# Web endpoints can be methods on a [`modal.Cls`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions#container-lifecycle-functions-and-parameters),
# which allows you to manage the container's lifecycle independently from processing individual requests.

# This example will only set the `start_time` instance variable once, on container startup.


@app.cls()
class WebApp:
    @modal.enter()
    def startup(self):
        from datetime import datetime, timezone

        print("🏁 Starting up!")
        self.start_time = datetime.now(timezone.utc)

    @modal.fastapi_endpoint(docs=True)
    def web(self):
        from datetime import datetime, timezone

        current_time = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
        return {"start_time": self.start_time, "current_time": current_time}


# ## Protect web endpoints with proxy authentication

# Sharing your Python functions on the web is great, but it's not always a good idea
# to make those functions available to just anyone.

# For example, you might have a function like the one below that
# is more expensive to run than to call (and so might be abused by your enemies)
# or reveals information that you would rather keep secret.

# To protect your Modal web endpoints so that they can't be triggered except
# by members of your [Modal workspace](https://modal.com/docs/guide/workspaces),
# add the `requires_proxy_auth=True` flag to the `fastapi_endpoint` decorator.


@app.function(gpu="h100")
@modal.fastapi_endpoint(requires_proxy_auth=True, docs=False)
def expensive_secret():
    return "I didn't care for 'The Godfather'. It insists upon itself."


# The `expensive-secret` endpoint URL will still be printed to the output when you `modal serve` or `modal deploy`,
# along with a "🔑" emoji indicating that it is secured with proxy authentication.
# If you head to that URL via the browser, you will get a
# [`401 Unauthorized`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401) error code in response.
# You should also check the dashboard page for this app (at the URL printed at the very top of the `modal` command output)
# so you can see that no containers were spun up to handle the request -- this authorization is handled entirely inside Modal's infrastructure.

# You can trigger the web endpoint by [creating a Proxy Auth Token](https://modal.com/settings/proxy-auth-tokens)
# and then including the token ID and secret in the `Modal-Key` and `Modal-Secret` headers.

# From the command line, that might look like

# ```shell
# export TOKEN_ID=wk-1234abcd
# export TOKEN_SECRET=ws-1234abcd
# curl -H "Modal-Key: $TOKEN_ID" \
#      -H "Modal-Secret: $TOKEN_SECRET" \
#      https://your-workspace-name--expensive-secret.modal.run
# ```

# For more details, see the
# [guide to proxy authentication](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhook-proxy-auth).

# ## What next?

# Modal's `fastapi_endpoint` decorator is opinionated and designed for relatively simple web applications --
# one or a few independent Python functions that you want to expose to the web.

# Three additional decorators allow you to serve more complex web applications with greater control:
# - [`asgi_app`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#asgi) to serve applications compliant with the ASGI standard,
# like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
# - [`wsgi_app`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#wsgi) to serve applications compliant with the WSGI standard,
# like [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
# - [`web_server`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#non-asgi-web-servers) to serve any application that listens on a port
