# # Add Modal Apps to Tailscale

# This example demonstrates how to integrate Modal with Tailscale (https://tailscale.com).
# It outlines the steps to configure Modal containers so that they join the Tailscale network.

# We use a custom entrypoint to automatically add containers to a Tailscale network (tailnet).
# This configuration enables the containers to interact with one another and with
# additional applications within the same tailnet.


import modal

# Install Tailscale and copy custom entrypoint script ([entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-examples/blob/main/10_integrations/tailscale/entrypoint.sh)). The script must be
# executable.

    resp = requests.get("http://my-tailscale-machine:5000")
    print(resp.content)


# Run this script with `modal run modal_tailscale.py`. You will see Tailscale logs
# when the container start indicating that you were able to login successfully and
# that the proxies (SOCKS5 and HTTP) have created been successfully. You will also
# be able to see Modal containers in your Tailscale dashboard in the "Machines" tab.
# Every new container launched will show up as a new "machine". Containers are
# individually addressable using their Tailscale name or IP address.
