# # Document OCR job queue
#
# This tutorial shows you how to use Modal as an infinitely scalable job queue
# that can service async tasks from a web app. For the purpose of this tutorial,
# we've also built a [React + FastAPI web app on Modal](https://modal.com/docs/examples/doc_ocr_webapp)
# that works together with it, but note that you don't need a web app running on Modal
# to use this pattern. You can submit async tasks to Modal from any Python
# application (for example, a regular Django app running on Kubernetes).
#
# Our job queue will handle a single task: running OCR transcription for images.
# We'll make use of a pre-trained Document Understanding model using the
# [`donut`](https://github.com/clovaai/donut) package. Try
# it out for yourself [here](https://modal-labs--example-doc-ocr-webapp-wrapper.modal.run/).
#
# ![receipt parser frontend](./receipt_parser_frontend_2.jpg)

# ## Define an App
#
# Let's first import `modal` and define a [`App`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App).
# Later, we'll use the name provided for our `App` to find it from our web app, and submit tasks to it.

import urllib.request

import modal

app = modal.App("example-doc-ocr-jobs")

# ## Model cache
#
# `donut` downloads the weights for pre-trained models to a local directory, if those weights don't already exist.
# To decrease start-up time, we want this download to happen just once, even across separate function invocations.
# To accomplish this, we use the [`Image.run_function`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Image#run_function) method,
# which allows us to run some code at image build time to save the model weights into the image.

CACHE_PATH = "/root/model_cache"
MODEL_NAME = "naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-cord-v2"


def get_model():
    from donut import DonutModel

    pretrained_model = DonutModel.from_pretrained(
        MODEL_NAME,
        cache_dir=CACHE_PATH,
    )

    return pretrained_model


image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.9")
    .pip_install(
        "donut-python==1.0.7",
        "huggingface-hub==0.16.4",
        "transformers==4.21.3",
        "timm==0.5.4",
    )
    .run_function(get_model)
)

# ## Handler function
#
# Now let's define our handler function. Using the [@app.function()](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App#function)
# decorator, we set up a Modal [Function](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Function) that uses GPUs,
# runs on a [custom container image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container),
# and automatically [retries](https://modal.com/docs/guide/retries#function-retries) failures up to 3 times.


@app.function(
    gpu="any",
    image=image,
    retries=3,
)
def parse_receipt(image: bytes):
    import io

    import torch
    from PIL import Image

    # Use donut fine-tuned on an OCR dataset.
    task_prompt = "<s_cord-v2>"
    pretrained_model = get_model()

    # Initialize model.
    pretrained_model.half()
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    pretrained_model.to(device)

    # Run inference.
    input_img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image))
    output = pretrained_model.inference(image=input_img, prompt=task_prompt)[
        "predictions"
    ][0]
    print("Result: ", output)

    return output


# ## Deploy
#
# Now that we have a function, we can publish it by deploying the app:
#
# ```shell
# modal deploy doc_ocr_jobs.py
# ```
#
# Once it's published, we can [look up](https://modal.com/docs/guide/trigger-deployed-functions) this function
# from another Python process and submit tasks to it:
#
# ```python
# fn = modal.Function.lookup("example-doc-ocr-jobs", "parse_receipt")
# fn.spawn(my_image)
# ```
#
# Modal will auto-scale to handle all the tasks queued, and
# then scale back down to 0 when there's no work left. To see how you could use this from a Python web
# app, take a look at the [receipt parser frontend](https://modal.com/docs/examples/doc_ocr_webapp)
# tutorial.

# ## Run manually
#
# We can also trigger `parse_receipt` manually for easier debugging:
# `modal run doc_ocr_jobs::app.main`
# To try it out, you can find some
# example receipts [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S2D1gXd4YIft4a5wDtW99jfl38e85ouW).
