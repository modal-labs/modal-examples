# # Run a job queue for GOT-OCR

# This tutorial shows you how to use Modal as an infinitely scalable job queue
# that can service async tasks from a web app. For the purpose of this tutorial,
# we've also built a [React + FastAPI web app on Modal](https://modal.com/docs/examples/doc_ocr_webapp)
# that works together with it, but note that you don't need a web app running on Modal
# to use this pattern. You can submit async tasks to Modal from any Python
# application (for example, a regular Django app running on Kubernetes).

# Our job queue will handle a single task: running OCR transcription for images of receipts.
# We'll make use of a pre-trained model:
# the [General OCR Theory (GOT) 2.0 model](https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/GOT-OCR2_0).

# Try it out for yourself [here](https://modal-labs-examples--example-doc-ocr-webapp-wrapper.modal.run/).

# [![Webapp frontend](https://modal-cdn.com/doc_ocr_frontend.jpg)](https://modal-labs-examples--example-doc-ocr-webapp-wrapper.modal.run/)

# ## Define an App

# Let's first import `modal` and define an [`App`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App).
# Later, we'll use the name provided for our `App` to find it from our web app and submit tasks to it.

import modal

app = modal.App("example-doc-ocr-jobs")

# We also define the dependencies for our Function by specifying an
# [Image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/images).

inference_image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12").pip_install(
    "accelerate==0.28.0",
    "huggingface_hub[hf_transfer]==0.27.1",
    "numpy<2",
    "tiktoken==0.6.0",
    "torch==2.5.1",
    "torchvision==0.20.1",
    "transformers==4.48.0",
    "verovio==4.3.1",
)

# ## Cache the pre-trained model on a Modal Volume

# We can obtain the pre-trained model we want to run from Hugging Face
# using its name and a revision identifier.

MODEL_NAME = "ucaslcl/GOT-OCR2_0"
MODEL_REVISION = "cf6b7386bc89a54f09785612ba74cb12de6fa17c"

# The logic for loading the model based on this information
# is encapsulated in the `setup` function below.


def setup():
    import warnings

    from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

    with warnings.catch_warnings():  # filter noisy warnings from GOT modeling code
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
            MODEL_NAME, revision=MODEL_REVISION, trust_remote_code=True
        )

        model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
            MODEL_NAME,
            revision=MODEL_REVISION,
            trust_remote_code=True,
            device_map="cuda",
            use_safetensors=True,
            pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        )

    return tokenizer, model


# The `.from_pretrained` methods from Hugging Face are smart enough
# to only download models if they haven't been downloaded before.
# But in Modal's serverless environment, filesystems are ephemeral,
# and so using this code alone would mean that models need to get downloaded
# on every request.

# So instead, we create a Modal [Volume](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes)
# to store the model -- a durable filesystem that any Modal Function can access.

model_cache = modal.Volume.from_name("hf-hub-cache", create_if_missing=True)

# We also update the environment variables for our Function
# to include this new path for the model cache --
# and to enable fast downloads with the `hf_transfer` library.

MODEL_CACHE_PATH = "/root/models"
inference_image = inference_image.env(
    {"HF_HUB_CACHE": MODEL_CACHE_PATH, "HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER": "1"}
)


# ## Run OCR inference on Modal by wrapping with `app.function`

# Now let's set up the actual OCR inference.

# Using the [`@app.function`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App#function)
# decorator, we set up a Modal [Function](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Function).
# We provide arguments to that decorator to customize the hardware, scaling, and other features
# of the Function.

# Here, we say that this Function should use NVIDIA L40S [GPUs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu),
# automatically [retry](https://modal.com/docs/guide/retries#function-retries) failures up to 3 times,
# and have access to our [shared model cache](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes).


@app.function(
    gpu="l40s",
    retries=3,
    volumes={MODEL_CACHE_PATH: model_cache},
    image=inference_image,
)
def parse_receipt(image: bytes) -> str:
    from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

    tokenizer, model = setup()

    with NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, mode="wb+") as temp_img_file:
        temp_img_file.write(image)
        output = model.chat(tokenizer, temp_img_file.name, ocr_type="format")

    print("Result: ", output)

    return output


# ## Deploy

# Now that we have a function, we can publish it by deploying the app:

# ```shell
# modal deploy doc_ocr_jobs.py
# ```

# Once it's published, we can [look up](https://modal.com/docs/guide/trigger-deployed-functions) this Function
# from another Python process and submit tasks to it:

# ```python
# fn = modal.Function.from_name("example-doc-ocr-jobs", "parse_receipt")
# fn.spawn(my_image)
# ```

# Modal will auto-scale to handle all the tasks queued, and
# then scale back down to 0 when there's no work left. To see how you could use this from a Python web
# app, take a look at the [receipt parser frontend](https://modal.com/docs/examples/doc_ocr_webapp)
# tutorial.

# ## Run manually

# We can also trigger `parse_receipt` manually for easier debugging:

# ```shell
# modal run doc_ocr_jobs
# ```

# To try it out, you can find some
# example receipts [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S2D1gXd4YIft4a5wDtW99jfl38e85ouW).
