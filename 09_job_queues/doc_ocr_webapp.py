# # Document OCR web app

# This tutorial shows you how to use Modal to deploy a fully serverless
# [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application.
# We're going to build a simple "Receipt Parser" web app that submits OCR transcription
# tasks to a separate Modal app defined in the [Job Queue tutorial](https://modal.com/docs/examples/doc_ocr_jobs),
# polls until the task is completed, and displays
# the results. Try it out for yourself
# [here](https://modal-labs-examples--example-doc-ocr-webapp-wrapper.modal.run/).

# ![receipt parser frontend](./receipt_parser_frontend.jpg)

# ## Basic setup

# Let's get the imports out of the way and define a [`App`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App).

from pathlib import Path

import fastapi
import fastapi.staticfiles
import modal

app = modal.App("example-doc-ocr-webapp")

# Modal works with any [ASGI](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#serving-asgi-and-wsgi-apps) or
# [WSGI](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#wsgi) web framework. Here, we choose to use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

web_app = fastapi.FastAPI()

# ## Define endpoints

# We need two endpoints: one to accept an image and submit it to the Modal job queue,
# and another to poll for the results of the job.

# In `parse`, we're going to submit tasks to the function defined in the [Job
# Queue tutorial](https://modal.com/docs/examples/doc_ocr_jobs), so we import it first using
# [`Function.lookup`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Function#lookup).

# We call [`.spawn()`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Function#spawn) on the function handle
# we imported above to kick off our function without blocking on the results. `spawn` returns
# a unique ID for the function call, which we then use
# to poll for its result.


@web_app.post("/parse")
async def parse(request: fastapi.Request):
    parse_receipt = modal.Function.lookup(
        "example-doc-ocr-jobs", "parse_receipt"
    )

    form = await request.form()
    receipt = await form["receipt"].read()  # type: ignore
    call = parse_receipt.spawn(receipt)
    return {"call_id": call.object_id}


# `/result` uses the provided `call_id` to instantiate a `modal.FunctionCall` object, and attempt
# to get its result. If the call hasn't finished yet, we return a `202` status code, which indicates
# that the server is still working on the job.


@web_app.get("/result/{call_id}")
async def poll_results(call_id: str):
    function_call = modal.functions.FunctionCall.from_id(call_id)
    try:
        result = function_call.get(timeout=0)
    except TimeoutError:
        return fastapi.responses.JSONResponse(content="", status_code=202)

    return result


# Finally, we mount the static files for our front-end. We've made [a simple React
# app](https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-examples/tree/main/09_job_queues/doc_ocr_frontend)
# that hits the two endpoints defined above. To package these files with our app, first
# we get the local assets path, and then create a modal [`Mount`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/local-data#mounting-directories)
# that mounts this directory at `/assets` inside our container. Then, we instruct FastAPI to [serve
# this static file directory](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/static-files/) at our root path.

assets_path = Path(__file__).parent / "doc_ocr_frontend"


@app.function(
    image=modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12").pip_install(
        "fastapi[standard]==0.115.4"
    ),
    mounts=[modal.Mount.from_local_dir(assets_path, remote_path="/assets")],
)
@modal.asgi_app()
def wrapper():
    web_app.mount(
        "/", fastapi.staticfiles.StaticFiles(directory="/assets", html=True)
    )

    return web_app


# ## Running

# While developing, you can run this as an ephemeral app by executing the command

# ```shell
# modal serve doc_ocr_webapp.py
# ```

# Modal watches all the mounted files and updates the app if anything changes.
# See [these docs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#developing-with-modal-serve)
# for more details.

# ## Deploy

# To deploy your application, run

# ```shell
# modal deploy doc_ocr_webapp.py
# ```

# That's all!

# If successful, this will print a URL for your app that you can navigate to in
# your browser ðŸŽ‰ .
