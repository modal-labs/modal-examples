# # Use Modal Dicts and Queues together

# Modal Dicts and Queues store and communicate objects in distributed applications on Modal.

# To illustrate how Dicts and Queues can interact together in a simple distributed
# system, consider the following example program that crawls the web, starting
# from some initial page and traversing links to many sites in breadth-first order.

# The Modal Queue acts as a job queue, accepting new pages to crawl as they are discovered
# by the crawlers and doling them out to be crawled via [`.spawn`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Function#spawn).

# The Dict is used to coordinate termination once the maximum number of URLs to crawl is reached.

# Starting from Wikipedia, this spawns several dozen containers (auto-scaled on
# demand) and crawls about 100,000 URLs per minute.
