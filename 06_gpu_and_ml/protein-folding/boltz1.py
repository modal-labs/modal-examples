# # Fold proteins with Boltz-1

# Boltz-1 is an open source molecular structure prediction model that matches the performance of closed source models like AlphaFold 3.
# It was created by the [MIT Jameel Clinic](https://jclinic.mit.edu/boltz-1/).
# For details, see [their technical report](https://gcorso.github.io/assets/boltz1.pdf).

# Here, we demonstrate how to run Boltz-1 on Modal.

# ## Setup

from dataclasses import dataclass
from pathlib import Path

import modal

here = Path(__file__).parent  # the directory of this file

MINUTES = 60  # seconds

app = modal.App(name="example-boltz1-inference")

# ## Fold a protein from the command line

# The logic for running Boltz-1 is encapsulated in the function below,
# which you can trigger from the command line by running

# ```shell
# modal run boltz1
# ```

# This will set up the environment for running Boltz-1 inference in Modal's cloud,
# run it, and then save the results locally as a [tarball](https://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/FAQ/whats-tarball-or-how-do-i-unpack-or-create-tgz-or-targz-file).
# That tarball archive contains, among other things, the predicted structure as a
# [Crystallographic Information File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_Information_File),
# which you can render with the online [Molstar Viewer](https://molstar.org/viewer).

# You can pass any options for the [`boltz predict` command line tool](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/blob/2355c62c957e95305527290112e9742d0565c458/docs/prediction.md)
# as a string, like

# ``` shell
# modal run boltz1 --args "--sampling_steps 10"
# ```

# To see more options, run the command with the `--help` flag.

# To learn how it works, read on!

# ## Installing Boltz-1 Python dependencies on Modal

# Code running on Modal runs inside containers built from [container images](https://modal.com/docs/guide/images)
# that include that code's dependencies.

# Because Modal images include [GPU drivers](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cuda) by default,
# installation of higher-level packages like `boltz` that require GPUs is painless.

# Here, we do it in a few lines, using the `uv` package manager for extra speed.

image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12").run_commands(
    "uv pip install --system --compile-bytecode boltz==0.3.2"
)

# ## Storing Boltz-1 model weights on Modal with Volumes

# Not all "dependencies" belong in a container image. Boltz-1, for example, depends on
# the weights of the model and a [Chemical Component Dictionary](https://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd) (CCD) file.

# Rather than loading them dynamically at run-time (which would add several minutes of GPU time to each inference),
# or installing them into the image (which would require they be re-downloaded any time the other dependencies changed),
# we load them onto a [Modal Volume](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes).
# A Modal Volume is a file system that all of your code running on Modal (or elsewhere!) can access.
# For more on storing model weights on Modal, see [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/model-weights).
# For details on how we download the weights in this case, see the [Addenda](#addenda).

boltz_model_volume = modal.Volume.from_name(
    "boltz1-models", create_if_missing=True
)
models_dir = Path("/models/boltz1")

# ## Running Boltz-1 on Modal

# To run inference on Modal we wrap our function in a decorator, `@app.function`.
# We provide that decorator with some arguments that describe the infrastructure our code needs to run:
# the Volume we created, the Image we defined, and of course a fast GPU!

# Note that the `boltz` command-line tool we use takes the path to a
# [specially-formatted YAML file](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/blob/2355c62c957e95305527290112e9742d0565c458/docs/prediction.md)
# that includes definitions of molecules to predict the structures of and optionally paths to
# [Multiple Sequence Alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment) (MSA) files
# for any protein molecules. See the [Addenda](#addenda) for details.
