# # Run OpenAI's first OSS model with vLLM

# It's hard to remember now but OpenAI was founded with the mission of ensuring
# that the most powerful AI models wouldn't be controlled exclusively by
# for-profit corporations. But the compute-demands of AI couldn't be ignored and
# they partnered with Microsoft and surprised the world with ChatGPT in December
# 2022, a bot that made us all question if the Turing test was on the verge of
# being solvedâ€”hitting 100 million users in just two months. But the open source
# community pushed back hard, people wanted modifiable models they could actually
# control, and LLaMA, Qwen, and DeepSeek all became serious rivals that trailed
# closed-source performance by only 6-12 months year after year. Now OpenAI is
# teetering back to its roots, releasing their very first open source model.

# The cracked engineers at vLLM have brought 0-day support for it and we're supplying
# the infrastructure so anyone can run it.

# ## Set up the container image

# We'll start by defining a [custom container `Image`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container) that
# install all the necessary dependencies to run vLLM and the model. This will include `amd-quark` which is
# AMD's quantization library that support [`mxfp4`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_floating_point#Microscaling_(MX)_Formats)
# quantization. OpenAI has provided the model is `mxfp4` format.
