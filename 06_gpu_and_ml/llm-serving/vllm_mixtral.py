# # Fast inference with vLLM (Mixtral 8x7B)
#
# In this example, we show how to run basic inference, using [`vLLM`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
# to take advantage of PagedAttention, which speeds up sequential inferences with optimized key-value caching.
#
# We are running the [Mixtral 8x7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) model here,
# which is a mixture-of-experts model finetuned for conversation.
# You can expect ~3 minute cold starts.
# For a single request, the throughput is over 50 tokens/second.
# The larger the batch of prompts, the higher the throughput (up to hundreds of tokens per second).
#
# ## Setup
#
# First we import the components we need from `modal`.

MODEL_NAME = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
GPU_CONFIG = modal.gpu.A100(memory=80, count=2)


# ## Define a container image
#
# We want to create a Modal image which has the model weights pre-saved to a directory. The benefit of this
# is that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Huggingface - instead, it will take
# advantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.
#
# ### Download the weights
#
# We can download the model to a particular directory using the HuggingFace utility function `snapshot_download`.
#
# Mixtral is beefy, at nearly 100 GB in `safetensors` format, so this can take some time -- at least a few minutes.
#
# Tip: avoid using global variables in this function. Changes to code outside this function will not be detected and the download step will not re-run.

# ### Image definition
# We’ll start from a Dockerhub image recommended by `vLLM`, and use
# run_function to run the function defined above to ensure the weights of
# the model are saved within the container image.

# ## The model class
#
# The inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `@enter` decorator.
# This enables us to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up, and keep it cached
# on the GPU for each subsequent invocation of the function.
#
# The `vLLM` library allows the code to remain quite clean. We do have to patch the multi-GPU setup due to issues with Ray.

# ## Coupling a frontend web application
#
# We can stream inference from a FastAPI backend, also deployed on Modal.
#
# You can try our deployment [here](https://modal-labs--vllm-mixtral.modal.run).
