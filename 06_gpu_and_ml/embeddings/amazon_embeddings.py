# # Embed 30 million Amazon reviews with Qwen2-7B

# This example demonstrates how to create embeddings for a large text dataset. This is
# often necessary to enable semantic search, translation, and other language
# processing tasks. Modal makes it easy to deploy large, capable embedding models and handles
# all of the scaling to process very large datasets in parallel on many cloud GPUs.

# We create a Modal Function that will handle all of the data loading and submit inputs to an
# inference Cls that will automatically scale up to handle hundreds of large
# batches in parallel.

# Between the time a batch is submitted and the time it is fetched, it is stored via
# Modal's `spawn` system, which can hold onto up to one million inputs for up to a week.

import json

import modal

app = modal.App(name="example-amazon-embeddings")
MINUTES = 60  # seconds
HOURS = 60 * MINUTES

# We define our `main` function as a `local_entrypoint`. This is what we'll call locally
# to start the job on Modal.

# You can run it with the command

# ```bash
# modal run --detach large_scale_embedding.py
# ```

# By default we `down-scale` to 1/100th of the data for demonstration purposes.
# To launch the full job, set the `--down-scale` parameter to `1`.
# But note that this will cost you!

# The entrypoint starts the job and gets back a `f`unction `c`all ID for each batch.
# We can use these IDs to retrieve the embeddings once the job is finished.
# Modal will keep the results around for up to 7 days after completion. Take a look at our
# [job processing guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/job-queue)
# for more details.

    out_path.write_text(json.dumps(function_ids, indent=2) + "\n")
    print(f"output handles saved to {out_path}")


# ## Load the data and start the inference job

# Next we define the Function that will do the data loading and feed it to our embedding model.
# We define a container [Image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/images)
# with the data loading dependencies.

# In it, we download the data we need and cache it to the container's local disk,
# which will disappear when the job is finished. We will be saving the review data
# along with the embeddings, so we don't need to keep the dataset around.

# Embedding a large dataset like this can take some time, but we don't need to wait
# around for it to finish. We use `spawn` to invoke our embedding Function
# and get back a handle with an ID that we can use to get the results later.
# This can bottleneck on just sending data over the network for processing, so
# we speed things up by using `ThreadPoolExecutor` to submit batches using multiple threads.

# Once all of the batches have been sent for inference, we can return the function IDs
# to the local client to save.

# ## Massively scaling up and scaling out embedding inference on many beefy GPUs

# We're going to spin up many containers to run inference, and we don't want each
# one to have to download the embedding model from Hugging Face. We can download and save it to a
# Modal [Volume](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes)
# during the image build step using `run_function`.

# We'll use the
# [GTE-Qwen2-7B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct)
# model from Alibaba, which performs well on the
# [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).

# For inference, we will use Hugging Face's
# [Text Embeddings Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference)
# framework for embedding model deployment.

# Running lots of separate machines is "scaling out". But we can also "scale up"
# by running on large, high-performance machines.

# We'll use L40S GPUs for a good balance between cost and performance. Hugging Face has
# prebuilt Docker images we can use as a base for our Modal Image.
# We'll use the one built for the L40S's
# [SM89/Ada Lovelace architecture](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor-architecture)
# and install the rest of our dependencies on top.

# Next we define our inference class. Modal will auto-scale the number of

# and `@modal.concurrent` decorators. Here we limit the total number of containers to
# 100 and the maximum number of concurrent inputs to 10, which caps us at 1000 concurrent batches.
# On Modal's Starter (free) and Team plans, the maximum number of concurrent GPUs is lower,
# reducing the total number of concurrent batches and so the throughput.

# Customers on Modal's Enterprise Plan regularly scale up another order of magnitude above this.
# If you're interested in running on thousands of GPUs,
# [get in touch](https://form.fillout.com/t/onUBuQZ5vCus).

# Here we also specify the GPU type and attach the Modal Volume where we saved the
# embedding model.

# This class will spawn a local Text Embeddings Inference server when the container
# starts, and process each batch by receiving the text data over HTTP, returning a list of
# tuples with the batch text data and embeddings.

# ## Helper Functions

# The book review dataset contains ~30M reviews with ~12B total characters,
# indicating an average review length of ~500 characters. Some are much longer.
# Embedding models have a limit on the number of tokens they can process in a single
# input. We will need to split each review into chunks that are under this limit.

# The proper way to split text data is to use a tokenizer to ensure that any
# single request is under the models token limit, and to overlap chunks to provide
# semantic context and preserve information. For the sake of this example, we're going
# just to split by a set character length (`CHUNK_SIZE`).

# While the embedding model has a limit on the number of input tokens for a single
# embedding, the number of chunks that we can process in a single batch is limited by
# the VRAM of the GPU. We set the `BATCH_SIZE` accordingly.
