# # Generate videos from text prompts with Mochi

# This example demonstrates how to run the [Mochi 1](https://github.com/genmoai/models)
# video generation model by [Genmo](https://www.genmo.ai/) on Modal.

# Here's one that we generated, inspired by our logo:

# <center>
# <video controls autoplay loop muted>
# <source src="https://modal-public-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/modal-logo-splat.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
# </video>
# </center>

# Note that the Mochi model, at time of writing,
# requires several minutes on one H100 to produce
# a high-quality clip of even a few seconds.
# So a single video generation therefore costs about $0.33
# at our ~$5/hr rate for H100s.

# Keep your eyes peeled for improved efficiency
# as the open source community works on this new model.
# We welcome PRs to improve the performance of this example!

# ## Setting up the environment for Mochi

# At the time of writing, Mochi is supported natively in the [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library.
# We'll install install diffusers from source to get these latest features.

# We'll use the `modal.cls` decorator to define a [Modal Class](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions)
# which we use to control the lifecycle of our cloud container.
# 
# We configure it to use our image, the distributed volume, and a single H100 GPU.

# ## Running Mochi inference

# We can trigger Mochi inference from our local machine by running the code in
# the local entrypoint below.

# It ensures the model is downloaded into the image,
# spins up a replica to generate a video,
# and then downloads that video to the local machine.

# You can trigger it with:

# ```bash
# modal run --detach mochi
# ```
# 
# Optional command line flags are:
# --prompt="your prompt"
# --negative-prompt="your negative prompt"
# --num-inference-steps=200
# --guidance-scale=4.5
# --num-frames=19
# 
# Such as:
# ```bash
# modal run --detach mochi --prompt="a cat playing drums in a jazz ensemble" --num-inference-steps=64
# ```
