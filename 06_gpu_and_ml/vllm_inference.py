# # Fast inference with vLLM (Llama 2 13B)

# In this example, we show how to run basic inference, using [`vLLM`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
# to take advantage of PagedAttention, which speeds up sequential inferences with optimized key-value caching.
#
# `vLLM` also supports a use case as a FastAPI server which we will explore in a future guide. This example
# walks through setting up an environment that works with `vLLM ` for basic inference.
#
# We are running the Llama 2 13B model here, and you can expect 30 second cold starts and 110 tokens/second during inference.
# The example generates around 1800 tokens in 16 seconds.
#
# To run
# [any of the other supported models](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models.html),
# simply replace the model name in the download step. You may also need to enable `trust_remote_code` for MPT models (see comment below)..
#
# ## Setup
#
# First we import the components we need from `modal`.

from modal import Stub, Image, Secret, method
import os


# ## Define a container image
#
# We want to create a Modal image which has the model weights pre-saved to a directory. The benefit of this
# is that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Huggingface - instead, it will take
# advantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.
#
# ### Download the weights
#
# Since the weights are gated on HuggingFace, we must request access in two places:
# - on the [model card page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)
# - accept the license [on the Meta website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/).
#
# Next, [create a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
# To access the token in a Modal function, we can create a secret on the [secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets).
# Now the token will be available via the environment variable named `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`. Functions that inject this secret will have access to the environment variable.
#
# We can download the model to a particular directory using the HuggingFace utility function `snapshot_download`.
#
# Tip: avoid using global variables in this function. Changes to code outside this function will not be detected and the download step will not re-run.
def download_model_to_folder():
    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

    snapshot_download("meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", local_dir="/model", token=os.environ["HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN"])

MODEL_DIR = "/model"

# ### Image definition
# We’ll start from a Dockerhub image recommended by `vLLM`, upgrade the older
# version of `torch` to a new one specifically built for CUDA 11.8. Next, we install `vLLM` from source to get the latest updates.
# Finally, we’ll use run_function to run the function defined above to ensure the weights of the model
# are saved within the container image.
#
image = (
    Image.from_dockerhub("nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.12-py3")

# ## The model class
#
# The inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `__enter__` method.
# This enables us to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up, and keep it cached
# on the GPU for each subsequent invocation of the function.
#
# The `vLLM` library allows the code to remain quite clean.
