# # Create your own music samples with MusicGen

# MusicGen is a popular open-source music-generation model family from Meta.
# In this example, we show you how you can run MusicGen models on Modal GPUs,
# along with a Gradio UI for playing around with the model.

# We use [ACE-Step-v1-3.5B](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step),
# the inference library released by ACE Studio and StepFun
# for MusicGen and its kin, like AudioGen.

# ## Setting up dependencies

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
from uuid import uuid4

import modal

# We start by defining the environment our generation runs in.
# This takes some explaining since, like most cutting-edge ML environments, it is a bit fiddly.

# This environment is captured by a
# [container image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container),
# which we build step-by-step by calling methods to add dependencies,
# like `apt_install` to add system packages and `pip_install` to add
# Python packages.

# Note that we don't have to install anything with "CUDA"
# in the name -- the drivers come for free with the Modal environment
# and the rest gets installed `pip`. That makes our life a lot easier!
# If you want to see the details, check out [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu)
# in our docs.

image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.11")
    .apt_install("git", "ffmpeg")
    .uv_pip_install(
        "torch==2.8.0",
        "torchaudio==2.8.0",
        "git+https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step.git@6ae0852b1388de6dc0cca26b31a86d711f723cb3",  # we can install directly from GitHub!
    )
)

# In addition to source code, we'll also need the model weights.

# ACE-Step integrates with the Hugging Face ecosystem, so setting up the models
# is straightforward. ACEStepPipeline internally uses the Hugging Face model hub
# to download the weights if not already present.


def load_model(and_return=False):
    from acestep.pipeline_ace_step import ACEStepPipeline

    model_demo = ACEStepPipeline(dtype="bfloat16", cpu_offload=False)
    if and_return:
        return model_demo


# But Modal Functions are serverless: instances spin down when they aren't being used.
# If we want to avoid downloading the weights every time we start a new instance,
# we need to store the weights somewhere besides our local filesystem.

# So we add a Modal [Volume](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes)
# to store the weights in the cloud. For more on storing model weights on Modal, see
# [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/model-weights).

cache_dir = "/root/.cache/ace-step/checkpoints"
model_cache = modal.Volume.from_name("ACE-Step-model-cache", create_if_missing=True)

# We don't need to change any of the model loading code --
# we just need to make sure the model gets stored in the right directory.

# To do that, we set an environment variable that Hugging Face expects
# (and another one that speeds up downloads, for good measure)
# and then run the `load_model` Python function.

image = image.env(
    {"HF_HUB_CACHE": cache_dir, "HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSER": "1"}
).run_function(load_model, volumes={cache_dir: model_cache})

# While we're at it, let's also define the environment for our UI.
# We'll stick with Python and so use FastAPI and Gradio.

web_image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.11").pip_install(
    "fastapi[standard]==0.115.4", "gradio==4.44.1"
)

# This is a totally different environment from the one we run our model in.
# Say goodbye to Python dependency conflict hell!

# ## Running music generation on Modal

# Now, we write our music generation logic.

# - We make an [App](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps) to organize our deployment.
# - We load the model at start, instead of during inference, with `modal.enter`,
# which requires that we use a Modal [`Cls`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions).
# - In the `app.cls` decorator, we specify the Image we built and attach the Volume.
# We also pick a GPU to run on -- here, an NVIDIA L40S.

app = modal.App("example-musicgen")

# You can execute it with a command like:

# ``` shell
# modal run musicgen.py --prompt="Baroque boy band, Bachstreet Boys, basso continuo, Top 40 pop music" --duration=60
# ```

# ## Hosting a web UI for the music generator

# With the Gradio library, we can create a simple web UI in Python
# that calls out to our music generator,
# then host it on Modal for anyone to try out.

# To deploy both the music generator and the UI, run

# ``` shell
# modal deploy musicgen.py
# ```

# Share the URL with your friends and they can generate their own songs!
