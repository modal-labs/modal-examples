# # Create music with ACE-Step

# In this example, we show you how you can run [Ace Studio](https://acestudio.ai/)'s
# [ACE-Step](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step) music generation model
# on Modal.

# ## Setting up dependencies

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
from uuid import uuid4

import modal

# We start by defining the environment our generation runs in.
# This takes some explaining since, like most cutting-edge ML environments, it is a bit fiddly.

# This environment is captured by a
# [container image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container),
# which we build step-by-step by calling methods to add dependencies,
# like `apt_install` to add system packages and `pip_install` to add
# Python packages.

# Note that we don't have to install anything with "CUDA"
# in the name -- the drivers come for free with the Modal environment
# and the rest gets installed `pip`. That makes our life a lot easier!
# If you want to see the details, check out [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu)
# in our docs.

image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12")
    .apt_install("git", "ffmpeg")
    .uv_pip_install(
        "torch==2.8.0",
        "torchaudio==2.8.0",
        "git+https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step.git@6ae0852b1388de6dc0cca26b31a86d711f723cb3",  # we can install directly from GitHub!
    )
)

# In addition to source code, we'll also need the model weights.

# ACE-Step integrates with the Hugging Face ecosystem, so setting up the models
# is straightforward. `ACEStepPipeline` internally uses the Hugging Face model hub
# to download the weights if not already present.


def load_model(and_return=False):
    from acestep.pipeline_ace_step import ACEStepPipeline

    model_demo = ACEStepPipeline(dtype="bfloat16", cpu_offload=False, overlapped_decode=True)
    if and_return:
        return model_demo


# But Modal Functions are serverless: instances spin down when they aren't being used.
# If we want to avoid downloading the weights every time we start a new instance,
# we need to store the weights somewhere besides our local filesystem.

# So we add a Modal [Volume](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes)
# to store the weights in the cloud. For more on storing model weights on Modal, see
# [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/model-weights).

cache_dir = "/root/.cache/ace-step/checkpoints"
model_cache = modal.Volume.from_name("ACE-Step-model-cache", create_if_missing=True)

# We don't need to change any of the model loading code --
# we just need to make sure the model gets stored in the right directory.

# To do that, we set an environment variable that Hugging Face expects
# (and another one that speeds up downloads, for good measure)
# and then run the `load_model` Python function.

image = image.env(
    {"HF_HUB_CACHE": cache_dir, "HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSER": "1"}
).run_function(load_model, volumes={cache_dir: model_cache})

# While we're at it, let's also define the environment for our UI.
# We'll stick with Python and so use FastAPI and Gradio.

web_image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12").uv_pip_install(
    "fastapi[standard]==0.115.4", "gradio==4.44.1"
)

# This is a totally different environment from the one we run our model in.
# Say goodbye to Python dependency conflict hell!

# ## Running music generation on Modal

# Now, we write our music generation logic.

# - We make an [App](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps) to organize our deployment.
# - We load the model at start, instead of during inference, with `modal.enter`,
# which requires that we use a Modal [`Cls`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions).
# - In the `app.cls` decorator, we specify the Image we built and attach the Volume.
# We also pick a GPU to run on -- here, an NVIDIA L40S.

Stars are dancing all around in cosmic tides
Feel the pulse of space and time beneath our feet
Every beat a heartbeat in this endless suite

Sailing through the velvet nights
We are echoes in a cosmic sea
In a universe where we are free

Planetary whispers in the sky tonight
Every constellation's got a secret sight
Distant worlds and moons we have yet to see
In the void of space where we can just be

Asteroids and comets in a ballet they spin
Lost in the rhythm of where our dreams begin
Close your eyes and let the synths take flight
We're voyagers on an electric night

Let the piano keys unlock the stars above
Every chord a memory every note is love
In this synth symphony we find our grace
Drifting forever in this boundless space

Sailing through the velvet nights
We are echoes in a cosmic sea
In a universe where we are free"""
