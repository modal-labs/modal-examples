# # Transform images with SDXL Turbo

# In this example, we run the SDXL Turbo model in _image-to-image_ mode:
# the model takes in a prompt and an image and transforms the image to better match the prompt.

# For example, the model transformed the image on the left into the image on the right based on the prompt
# _dog wizard, gandalf, lord of the rings, detailed, fantasy, cute, adorable, Pixar, Disney, 8k_.

# SDXL Turbo is a distilled model designed for fast, interactive image synthesis.
# Learn more about it [here](https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-sdxl-turbo).

# ## Define a container image

# First, we define the environment the model inference will run in,
# the [container image](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container).

        "diffusers~=0.24.0",  # Provides model libraries
        "huggingface-hub[hf-transfer]~=0.25.2",  # Lets us download models from Hugging Face's Hub

# ## Downloading, setting up, and running SDXL Turbo

# The Modal `Cls` defined below contains all the logic to download, set up, and run SDXL Turbo.

# The [container lifecycle](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions#container-lifecycle-beta) decorators
# `@build` and `@enter` ensure we download the model when building our container image and load it into memory
# when we start up a new instance of our `Cls`.

# The `inference` method runs the actual model inference. It takes in an image as a collection of `bytes` and a string `prompt` and returns
# a new image (also as a collection of `bytes`).

# To avoid excessive cold-starts, we set the `container_idle_timeout` to 240 seconds, meaning once a GPU has loaded the model it will stay
# online for 4 minutes before spinning down.
