# 2. We run any additional setup, like moving the model to the GPU, in methods decorated with `@enter`.
# We do our model optimizations in this step. For details, see the section on `torch.compile` below.
# 3. We run the actual inference in methods decorated with `@method`.

# To generate an image we just need to call the `Model`'s `generate` method
# with `.remote` appended to it.
# You can call `.generate.remote` from any Python environment that has access to your Modal credentials.
# The local environment will get back the image as bytes.

# Here, we wrap the call in a Modal [`local_entrypoint`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App#local_entrypoint)
# so that it can be run with `modal run`:

# ```bash
# modal run flux.py
# ```

# By default, we call `generate` twice to demonstrate how much faster
# the inference is after cold start. In our tests, clients received images in about 1.2 seconds.
# We save the output bytes to a temporary file.

# ## Speeding up Flux with `torch.compile`

# By default, we do some basic optimizations, like adjusting memory layout
# and re-expressing the attention head projections as a single matrix multiplication.
# But there are additional speedups to be had!

# PyTorch 2 added a compiler that optimizes the
# compute graphs created dynamically during PyTorch execution.
# This feature helps close the gap with the performance of static graph frameworks
# like TensorRT and TensorFlow.

# Here, we follow the suggestions from Hugging Face's
# [guide to fast diffusion inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/tutorials/fast_diffusion),
# which we verified with our own internal benchmarks.
# Review that guide for detailed explanations of the choices made below.

# The resulting compiled Flux `schnell` deployment returns images to the client in under a second (~700 ms), according to our testing.
# _Super schnell_!

# Compilation takes up to twenty minutes on first iteration.
# As of time of writing in late 2024,
# the compilation artifacts cannot be fully serialized,
# so some compilation work must be re-executed every time a new container is started.
# That includes when scaling up an existing deployment or the first time a Function is invoked with `modal run`.

# We cache compilation outputs from `nvcc`, `triton`, and `inductor`,
# which can reduce compilation time by up to an order of magnitude.
# For details see [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/torch_compile_caching_tutorial.html).

# You can turn on compilation with the `--compile` flag.
# Try it out with:

# ```bash
# modal run flux.py --compile
# ```

# The `compile` option is passed by a [`modal.parameter`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.parameter#modalparameter) on our class.
# Each different choice for a `parameter` creates a [separate auto-scaling deployment](https://modal.com/docs/guide/parameterized-functions).
# That means your client can use arbitrary logic to decide whether to hit a compiled or eager endpoint.
